# Database-Design-and-Implementation
- This is an academic group project that designs and implements the database component of a Fitness Center. 
- Based on 6 given mobile frameworks, we designed the EER model and then the relational model (3NF) for the database system
- After that, we started to develop SQL and noSQL queries to create the databases and insert data into them
- Finally, we developed SQL queries to retrieve data based on the 6 given wireframes
